- System integration: REST APIs, Protobuf serialization, Redis pub/sub, Qt6 event-driven GUI, Docker orchestration

**Engineering Practices:**
- Test automation: Unit (GoogleTest), BDD (Catch2), integration (pytest), load testing (k6), ~90% coverage target
- DevOps: GitHub Actions CI/CD, CMake build systems, semantic versioning, automated releases, comprehensive changelogs
- Documentation: Architecture diagrams, API documentation (Doxygen), troubleshooting guides, interview-ready presentation

**Standards Awareness:**
- MISRA C++ (embedded coding standards)
- IEC 62443 (industrial cybersecurity)
- ISO 21434 (automotive cybersecurity)
- IEC 62304 (medical device software lifecycle)
